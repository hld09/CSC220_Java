//Create and operate on a list of students’ records
//Student’s record contains attributes including
//Name, ID, Address, Age, Major, Minor, Classification (ex: Freshman,
//sophomore, Junior, Senior, Graduate) , GPA, and any other attribute(s) that you
//like to include.

//Create a Menu with the following options:
//0. To Quit/Exit.
//1. To Add a new student into the list.
//2. To View students’ list.
//2.1 View entire list
//2.2 View on specified major
//2.3 View on specified classification
//3. To Delete a student from the list.
//4. To Update a student’s record in the list.
//5. To Search for a student’s record.
//6. To Copy a list.

//Implementation Requirements:
//Define a FindStudent method to be used for Add, Delete,
//update, Search methods.
//For ADD:
//Duplicate record is not allowed. Student’s name is assumed to be the key.
//For Search Option:
//Student can be searched based on Name, or ID.
//Method FindStudent can be overloaded:
//FindStudent(stID) , FindStudent(stName)
//For Delete Option:
//A record is physically deleted from the list.
//- Output should be user friendly.
//- Appropriate variables naming; stRecord, stname, stmajor,…
//-

//- Use appropriate heading for your outputs/messages
//EX: Student to be deleted is not in the list, record xxx is already in the list,
//Student to be added is already in the list,…
//- Run your program with different data to cover all possible cases:
//- Record found, record is not in the list, duplicate record,….
//-
//- Submit your programs, outputs to the blackboard
